# Development Conventions
- Create a branch of *dev* for hotfixes and features.
- Create a pull request of that branch.
- Commit smaller changes to prevent reviewers from getting lost in the code.
- Titles should encompass the changes.
- Test before commiting.
- Keep code modular.
- Use "Updated", "Added", "Removed" in titles and descriptions.
- End every line with a period.
- Follow this format in descriptions (using line numbers when applicable):
```
- [<FILE> <LINES>] <INFO>
```
- Avoid technicalities and jargon in pull request titles and descriptions.
- Assign a developer, label, and project while creating a pull request.
- Assign a reviewer when the code is ready for review.
- Add issues using the [Issues Tracker](https://github.com/itsmistad/CryptoTrader/issues).
- Track pull requests on the [board](https://github.com/itsmistad/CryptoTrader/projects/1).
